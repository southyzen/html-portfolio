  <h1>WELCOME TO: ROBOTS</h1>

  <h5>A robot is a machine that can perform tasks autonomously or semi-autonomously, often mimicking human actions or behavior</h5>
  <h6>Below are some components commonly fond in robots</h6>
  <ul>
    <li>Chassis: The chassis is the physical body or framework of the robot that provides support and structure. It holds all the other components together.</li>
    <li>Power Source: Robots require a power source to operate. This can be in the form of batteries, rechargeable cells, or an external power supply.</li>
    <li>Actuators: Actuators are responsible for providing motion to the robot. They can be electric motors, servo motors, hydraulic systems, or pneumatic systems, depending on the type and purpose of the robot.</li>
    <li>Sensors: Sensors are used to perceive and gather data about the robot's environment. Common sensors include proximity sensors, light sensors, temperature sensors, accelerometers, gyroscopes, cameras, and microphones.</li>
    <li>Controllers: Controllers are the brains of the robot. They process input from sensors, make decisions, and send commands to the actuators. Microcontrollers or microprocessors are often used as controllers in robots.</li>
    <li>Manipulators: Manipulators are used for interacting with the environment. They can include robotic arms, grippers, or specialized tools for performing specific tasks.</li>
    <li>Communication Interface: Robots may have communication interfaces for interacting with external devices or systems. This can include wired or wireless connections, such as Ethernet, USB, Bluetooth, or Wi-Fi.</li>
    <li>Software: Robots rely on software programs to control their behavior, process sensor data, and perform tasks. This can include firmware embedded in microcontrollers, operating systems, control algorithms, and high-level software applications.</li>


  </ul>
